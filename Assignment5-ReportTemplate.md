# Introduction
The focus of this lab is for students to familiarize themselves with various concepts and tools required to assess the reliability of a system, given its failure data collected during integration testing. Reliability Growth Testing and Reliability assessment using Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC) will be used.

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
We split the work evenly across each person. We each spent time trying to understand what was required of us for this lab assignment, we then came to together shared our understanding of the requirements. We then all worked together on the same machine in order to complete the assignment and record the results.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
We faced quite a bit of difficulty, trying to figure out what to actually do for this lab as the instructions were very vague according to our understanding. To overcome this, we spoke to our TAs. In hindsight, it probably would've been a better idea if we contact our TAs a lot sooner.

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
Overall the assignment taught us some very important skills. We would've really appreciated it if the instructions for this lab were a lot more clearer. Moreover, the tools used for this lab were quite buggy and not compatible with all popular operating systems.
